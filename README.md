# SnakeGameProject

Made using C++ with OOPs Concepts

## Description
This is a **classic Snake Game** implemented in **C++** using **Object-Oriented 
Programming concepts**. The game is played in the console and features smooth gameplay with **real-time movement**, **multiple difficulty levels**, **obstacles**, and **special food types**.

This project was built to **demonstrate fundamental C++ programming concepts**, including the use of **vectors, enums, and structured game loops**. The game logic is efficiently designed to prevent flickering and ensures a smooth playing experience. Players can control the snake using `WASD` or arrow keys, navigate through obstacles, and aim for the highest score.

The project is designed to be **modular and extendable**, making it an excellent foundation for learning **game development in C++**.

## Introduction
This is **Snake Game** implemented using **C++** for rendering in a console and to control the snake, keyboard input. The game includes obstacles and different levels of difficulty, together with **special kinds of food**.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrinceGadara1/SnakeGameProject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```
3. Compile using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ snake.cpp -o snake.exe
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./snake.exe
   ```

## Features
- **Grid-based movement**: The snake moves within a defined grid.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Noob (Slow), Pro (Medium), or Legend (Fast).
- **Food Types**:
  - `F (Food)`: +10 points, grows snake by 1.
  - `S (Super Food)`: +30 points, grows snake by 3.
  - `M (Monster Food)`: +50 points, grows snake by 5.
- **Obstacles**: Random obstacles appear on the board, increasing the challenge.
- **Game Over Conditions**:
  - Snake collides with walls.
  - Snake collides with itself.
  - Snake collides with an obstacle.
- **Real-time Movement Control** using `WASD` or arrow keys.
- **Max Score**: Displays the highest score after the game ends.

## Data Structures Used
The game uses the following **data structures**:

1. **Vector (`vector<pair<int, int>> snake`)**:
   - Stores the coordinates of the snake's body.
   - The **first element** is the snake's head.
   - New positions are inserted at the front, and the tail is removed when moving.

2. **Vector (`vector<pair<int, int>> obstacles`)**:
   - Stores randomly generated obstacles that the snake must avoid.

3. **Pair (`pair<int, int>`)**:
   - Used to represent the `x` and `y` coordinates of the snake's body, food, and obstacles.

4. **Enumeration (`enum Direction`)**:
   - Represents the movement direction: `STOP`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`.

---

## How the Game Works

1. **Game Setup (`setupGame()`)**:
   - Initializes the grid size, difficulty level, and speed.
   - Places the snake at the center.
   - Generates obstacles and food.

2. **Rendering (`draw()`)**:
   - The game screen is drawn using a **buffer technique** (vector of strings) to reduce flickering.
   - The **snake** is represented by `'o'`.
   - The **snake head** is `'O'`.
   - **Food types** are `'F'`, `'S'`, `'M'`.
   - **Obstacles** are `'X'`.

3. **Handling Input (`input()`)**:
   - Reads keyboard input using `_kbhit()` and `_getch()`.
   - Prevents reversing direction instantly (e.g., moving left then right).

4. **Game Logic (`logic()`)**:
   - Moves the snake based on direction.
   - Checks if the snake **eats food** and grows accordingly.
   - Checks for **collisions** with walls, itself, or obstacles.

5. **Game Loop (`run()`)**:
   - Continuously updates the game until `gameOver == true`.
   - Handles restarting or exiting the game after losing.

## How to Play
1. Run the compiled program.
2. Enter the grid size and difficulty level.
3. Use `WASD` or arrow keys to control the snake.
4. Avoid obstacles (`X`), eat food (`F`, `S`, `M`) to grow.
5. The game ends if the snake collides with itself, walls, or obstacles.

---

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the game in **Windows**:
```sh
 g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game.exe
 ./snake_game.exe
```

---

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **pause feature**.
- Add a **scoreboard** to save high scores.
- Introduce **power-ups** (e.g., temporary invincibility).
